# orders_filtering
My final exam project for the JavaScript course.

We were given a JSON object of approx. 14k entries, each of them represents the order information from a recommendation system. We had to parse the data and outut certain data into 5 different tables. We were also given the screenshots of what the final results should have looked like.

We were also expected to add id properties to the original HTML file in order to be able to access the tables and output the results of our calculations there.
